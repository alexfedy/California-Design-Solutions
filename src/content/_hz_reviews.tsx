      "Kim and Ben did a phenomenal job renovating our entire house. We didn't know where to start, and Kim provided excellent guidance to design the home of our dreams. She planned our entire kitchen layout (including all brand new cabinets) and helped us choose everything from flooring, countertops, tiling, kitchen and bath faucets, paint colors, lighting, doors, and furniture. Ben and his team do top quality work and really pay attention to every detail. They made sure the job was done right as if it were their own home. They even do all the required permitting, which is a pain in our town. Everything turned out beautifully! Highly recommend!",

      "I don't even know where to start with how fabulous Kimberly and the rest of the team were in helping us remodel both of our bathrooms.  As soon as I met Kimberly and Ben, I knew we had found our team.  So professional and great with communication and detail.  Always on time and plus excellent craftsmanship.  Kimberly met with us, helped us pick out all items, and was so knowledgeable.  Yanis, was our main contact for construction and such a nice man and his team can do anything! If I ever have another project in the future this will be our team.  So thankful I found them on houzz.com.",

      "It is my honor and privilege to recommend Kim West.  I began my long association with her nearly 20 years ago when I needed window treatments for my dining room. This was the start of many years and many projects of working together on my townhome and now it is complete.  The biggest compliment I can give a designer I can give to Kim: her work has withstood the test of time!  Big bonus: her staff is incredible and beyond reproach - so very important - and I was very pleased to recommend her and them to my daughter and son in law who redid their master bath and kitchen with stunning results.",

      "Kimberley, Ben, and the team all did an excellent job remodeling the one bathroom in our modest 1930s home. Kim helped us choose a fabulous Italian tile for the bathroom floor and shower wall, as well as matching tiles for the shower, baseboard, and window trim. The two glass shower walls make our tiny bathroom feel much larger than it is. And the overall design, while modern, also connects to the look and feel of the 1930s. It was helpful to have Kim and Ben come out together for the first site visit to look at the existing layout, take measurements, and talk through ideas for the remodel. In addition to the tile, Kim helped us choose tile grout, cabinets and pulls, bathroom vanity, mirror, towel bars, faucet, shower head, and paint colors. Ben’s team was fantastic, especially Serge and the meticulous tile layer, Andrew. Yanis, our primary contact during the remodel, provided excellent communication, coordination of work, and customer support. We love our new bathroom, and we highly recommend the work of West Designs and California Design Solutions.",

      "Kimberley and Ben came out to give me an estimate for a kitchen renovation and I was immediately struck by their attention to detail when measuring out the kitchen and interest in what my vision/style was for the project.  They installed cabinets, countertops and appliances for my home.  They also built a media niche and mantle to match the kitchen. When there was not enough flooring to cover up the pre-existing footprint of the island, their team of installers were able to do the job.  When I asked for special outlets and lighting they did their best to accommodate my design vision and style.  All the installers who came to the house were polite, careful and professional.  There were points in the process when I had lots of questions; Kimberley and Ben were patient and kind to listen and wait for me to 'figure out' what I wanted.  The guys even pushed to finish the cooktop and sink in the kitchen so I could have a mostly functional kitchen for the Thanksgiving holiday.  I was so appreciative of that consideration.  Overall, I had a great experience working with K+B Designer/Builder.",

      "We are extremely satisfied with our new kitchen, especially with Kimberley's design: the layout of the cabinets, the refrigerator, oven, and countertops which is far more versatile and now allows two people to easily work in the kitchen. In addition, we also love the cabinets, the backsplash tiles, the floor, the paint colors, the wall and ceiling texturing as well as the end bookcase. All together, the kitchen is fantastic!  It suits our house and our lifestyle. We are grateful that most of the work was finished before we returned, and almost all the remainder of the work was completed the Monday after we returned from vacation 2 weeks early. Again, we love our new kitchen, and to us it was converted from a “pig’s ear” into a “silk purse”. Great design and great workmanship. We would recommend the work done on our kitchen.",

      "Kimberley and BEN had done a complete remodel of my son’s home that was just magnificent. Therefore, I couldn’t wait to have them start on my project, already knowing the great work that they do. How do I even begin to describe the magnificent spa bathroom that Kimberley and Ben and all of their craftsman have created for me. It is beyond my expectations!!  The workmanship that their craftsman demonstrated is second to none. I was amazed at how Hard they worked and with such care. They were all very kind and respectful, and it was a pleasure to have them in my home. Kimberley and BEN are simply the BEST at what they do, and they have built an incredible team of craftsman to work with them. .I have at least one more project that I have in mind in my home and I will definitely contact Kimberley and Ben again.  I Give them the highest recommendation possible.",
